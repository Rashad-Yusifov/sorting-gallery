1 step

you must import all file from /libs folder
and also you must import all /root/ JS / STYLE files

and also, you can import your icons to /icons folder

i've created example design like a orange box :)
but desing it doesn't matter for me, because i don't
know your website theme, so, if you wanna change any
color or somethings else, you can do it, you can create
styles files like a override.css and you may write code to
inside of override.css. that's alright, goodluck.
